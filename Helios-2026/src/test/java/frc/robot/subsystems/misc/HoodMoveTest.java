 * tests pin is the setpoint arithmetic (the clamp and the step-from-the-hood rule). The
 * direction-aware hoodMoveReached checks are gone with the open-loop move they belonged to.
 *
 * FLOOR is a RAW ENCODER reading now (the hood angle is the raw encoder angle), so the test uses
 * the live resting value rather than a physical degree.
