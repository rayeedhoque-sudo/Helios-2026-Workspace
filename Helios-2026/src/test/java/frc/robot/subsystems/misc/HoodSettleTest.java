 * moves the hood one step and it STAYS there.
 *
 * The hysteresis re-engage band (hoodShouldHold) that used to live here is DELETED, and this
 * file no longer tests it: a catch stroke moves the hood 25-55 raw units against a 3.75-unit
 * settle band, so re-engaging on droop could only ever overshoot, re-seed higher and droop
 * again -- the up/down limit cycle the team reported on 2026-08-28. The park is absolute now;
 * HoodHoldTest pins that. What is left here is the voltage arithmetic: a commanded stroke has
 * to be able to break the hood away, and nothing else may command anything.
